				<li><strong>Welcome message grows on connect</strong>: the welcome message grows and changes color when you log in and
					your username is set which helps visually indicate that you are connected to the app and in your
					account</li>
				<li><strong>Profile pic grows on connect</strong>: similar to the first animation, the profile picture grows when
					initially set which again shows when you're connected to the app</li>
				<li><strong>Profile pics in message thread grow on hover</strong> when you hover on a profile picture in the message
					thread, the picture grows which helps you see the person's image better. This is one of the annoying
					features of apps like Instagram where you can't zoom into a person's profile picture. This helps you
					figure out who you're talking to. </li>
				<li><strong>Buttons grow on hover</strong> hovering over an active button causes it to grow which indicates that you're
					currently on a button and is a safety precaution to prevent people from accidentally clicking a
					button. </li>
				<li><strong>Feedback message gradually changes</strong> in private messaging, there's a feedback message that tells you
					whether or not you're talking to a valid recipient. The animation eases the change which makes it
					easier on the eyes for the reader as opposed to a discontinuous change without the animation which
					can make the website feel very stark</li>
