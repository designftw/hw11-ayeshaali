		<h2>Chat App Write Up: HW#13</h2>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p>This Chat App is meant to help student organizations manage their communications. This app allows students to
			create new organizations, new channels within organizations, and events which can be pubbed in
			different channels. Many times, members will forgot or not even know that an event is happening because
			they'll miss communications that go to a number of different platforms. With this app, members will be able
			to more easily keep track of their events in a central location without having to wade through emails or
			consistently keep track of their messages on Messenger or Slack. This is also one of the reasons why the
			chats are kept separate from the events tab. This way, members don't have to search through different chats
			to find upcoming events and all of their events are located all together on one page. </p>

		<p> There is also an admin vs regular member distinction in the app, where an admin is allowed to make and pub
			events whereas a regular member is not. The creator of an organization is automatically given admin access
			and then that person can give others admin access. Members can also currently request admin access. Right
			now, requesting admin access immediately gives you access; however, in the future, current admins would
			receive these requests and be able to decide to approve them or not. In addition, members can RSVP to events
			which helps admin keep track of how many people are coming to events and plan the logistics accordingly and
			also helps other members because they'll be able to see which of their friends are going to an event.</p>
