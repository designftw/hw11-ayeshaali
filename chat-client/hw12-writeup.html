			<h3>I. Final Chat App Design</h3>
			<p>My final chat app will allow people to have different organizations and different chats within
				those organizations as well as a new events feature. Only the creator of the organization can create
				chats/events or allow other users to be able to create chats/events. I've narrowed the scope from my
				Figma mockup to not include all of the roles capabilities but still allow for admin functionality.</p>

			<h3>II. Halfway point</h3>
			<p>My app currently has set up the organizations and channels within them as well as a new page to create
				events and RSVP for them. The admin functionality hasn't been added yet. However, this marks a good
				halfway point as I have set up the two layer context structure of the app and can now work on
				modifications related to the actors.</p>
