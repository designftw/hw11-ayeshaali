				<li><strong>Read Indicators</strong></li>
				<p>I displayed read indicators within the details portion of a message as it's not the main point of a
					message and I didn't want the important parts of the message to become cluttered. I display the
					usernames of people rather than their actor ID to make it human readable.</p>

				<li><strong>Replies</strong></li>
				<p>My replies are designed to be in thread like with Slack. The messaging format is the same as for
					regular messages but formatted as a new list with indentation relative to the overall list of
					messages to indicate
					that that is the replies thread and I update the placeholder text to say that.</p>

				<li><strong>Profile Picture</strong></li>
				<p>I display the user's profile picture apart of the overall user information (setting names and
					username) at the top of the chat app. This provides consistency and efficiency because all of the
					user's information is displayed and can be changed in one place. I also add the profile picture of
					the sender of every message to the message headline which basically gives you the profile picture,
					name, and username of the person who sent the message. If the user's profile picture could not be
					downloaded, I provide a default user icon so that everyone has a user image which allows the message
					format to be consistent. </p>
